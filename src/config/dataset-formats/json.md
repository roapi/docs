# JSON

When a table uri ends in `.json`, ROAPI will try to load it as JSON table if no
`format` option is specified:

```yaml
tables:
  - name: "mytable"
    uri: "http://mytable.json"
```

## Filter by JSON pointer

Sometimes the JSON array you want to serve might be stored inside a JSON
object. To support this use-case, ROAPI supports loading JSON using a [JSON
pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).

Take the following JSON data as an example:

```json
{
    "x": {
        "y": [{"col1": "z"}, {"col1": "zz"}]
    }
}
```

In order to only serve `[{"col1": "z"}, {"col1": "zz"}]` through ROAPI, you can
configure the JSON table source as:

```yaml
tables:
  - name: "mytable"
    uri: "http://mytable.json"
    option:
      format: "json"
      pointer: "/x/y"
```


## Array encoding

Each row in JSON data can be encoded using array for size reduction. This
convention allows us to avoid repeating column names in every row.

For example:

```json
[
    {"col1": 1, "col2": "abc"},
    {"col1": 2, "col2": "efg"}
]
```

Can be stored as:


```json
[
    [1, "abc"],
    [2, "efg"]
]
```

However, when loading JSON rows using array encoding, you must explicitly specify
the schema, since there is no column name in the datasource anymore for ROAPI to
perform the schema inference.

```yaml
tables:
  - name: "mytable"
    uri: "http://mytable.json"
    option:
      format: "json"
      array_encoded: true
    schema:
      columns:
        - name: "col1"
          data_type: "Int64"
        - name: "col2"
          data_type: "Utf8"
```
